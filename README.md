# perceptron
Ruby implementation of Daniel Shiffman's Neural Networks tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk&amp;t=1s

This is a learning challenge and only written in ruby to grasp some of the basic concepts of a neural network in it's simplest form.

I tried to mimic the code structure of the turorial video to a point, but later I gave up so it's a bit of a mix.

I was not able to get the same 100% accuracy as the turorial though, but it's very close (_see: output_samples.png_)
